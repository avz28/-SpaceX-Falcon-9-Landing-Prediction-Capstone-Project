This repository contains my data science capstone project completed as part of the IBM Data Science specialization on Coursera. The project focuses on collecting, cleaning, exploring, and modeling SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to predict the success of first-stage landings, and building an interactive dashboard to visualize insights.
